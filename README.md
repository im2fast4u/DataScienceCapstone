# Data Science Capstone

The purpose of the Capstone Project is to develop a simple conceptual application that can predict next word based on a word that user enter. This is a similar concept used in several keyboard applications commonly found these days on mobile devices. One of the early pioneers in this fied was [Swiftkey](https://swiftkey.com/en).

The curriculum and the progression of development of the application involved several tasks, namely (1) Understanding the problem (2) Data acquisition and cleaning (3) Exploratory analysis (4) Statistical modelling (5) Predictive modelling (6) Creative exploration (7) Creating a data product (8) Creating a slide deck to pitch the product

The application is driven by big datasets from three different sources and structures of data, namely (1) Blogs (2) News and (3) Twitter. The source of the data was [HC Corpora](http://data.danetsoft.com/corpora.heliohost.org)
